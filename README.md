## **Development Tools and Platforms**  

To maximize accessibility and productivity, **MLprojects25** will utilize the following tools and platforms:  

### **Development Environment**  
- **Visual Studio Code:** For managing code, version control, and local development.  
- **Google Colab:** For experimenting, running notebooks, and sharing results in a cloud-based collaborative environment.  

### **Virtual Environments**  
To ensure reproducibility and avoid dependency conflicts, virtual environments will be used:  
```bash
python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate 
```

On Windows:
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```
You will see the environment name (env) appear in your terminal, indicating that it is active.

### **Install Dependencies**
After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary libraries for your projects. Make sure you have a requirements.txt file with the required dependencies listed. Install them with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you do not have a requirements.txt file yet, you can create one with the following example libraries:
```bash
numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn  
statsmodels  
tensorflow  
pytorch  
prophet  
```
To generate a requirements.txt file for your current environment, run:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
### **Core Libraries**

Below is a list of the core libraries used in the projects and their purposes:

NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For classical machine learning algorithms.
Statsmodels: For statistical models and time series analysis.
